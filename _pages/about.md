My name is Bing Zha (Chinese name: "查 冰") and I am currently working at Motorola Solutions (MSI) CTO Artificial Intelligence Team as a Research Scientist (Computer Vision). I was a PhD student in the [Photogrammetric Computer Vision Lab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/) in the [Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering](https://ceg.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15) and obtained PhD degree in 2021. Meanwhile, I earned Graduate Minor in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Track) from [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/). 

My research area was related to computer vision and deep learning, specifically focosing on geolocalization and 3d reconstruction. Currently, I am working on video analytics for surveillance task including object detection/tracking and pose estimation.
